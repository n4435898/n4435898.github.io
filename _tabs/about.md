### Who am I?

Floppa_Inspector/n4435898/Leonardo Park (박준서) from the [Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hankuk_Academy_of_Foreign_Studies), class of '27.

I'm mostly an ordinary kid. Highschool life is as goes; I have fun with my friends, do weird highschooler things, and just goof around. I guess the academic traits that arised from me is from the fact I grew up liking crafting things and tycoon games, thus I ended up studying programming and mathematics (mostly logic based stuff) because it's all really fascinating. I like thinking philosophically a lot, in fact I view programming as a more objective way to represent logic, just like math did in the past. And because I liked materializing my ideas, I worked on game development in elementary school and middle school, physics simulators and a basic game engine during middle school, and now I mostly work on competitive programming and theoretical aspects.


### What's this blog for?

It's mostly for noting down my thoughts, reviewing concepts I've studied and adding my own interpretation to maybe help others struggling to understand, and to satisfy my inner child that likes incremental progress. You can read this for more on [why I started this blog]({{site.url}}/posts/lets-start-here/)

P.S. I post my contest performance on [my youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCofdtu3w620r11AhHHedwOA) along with problem solving and topic videos/streams just like I do in my blog, so go check that out!

### Goals and progress

It's just mostly about the grind. I hope to build foundational understanding on general topics and increase pattern recognition skills not just for programming, but for life. But if I define a few clear, objective goals:
- [x] Make it back to CF Expert by the end of August 2025
- [ ] Reach CF Candidate Master by the end of 2025
- [ ] Reach AtCoder Blue by the end of 2025
- [ ] Reach CF Master by the end of 2026
- [ ] Reach USACO Platinum during 2025 November or December
- [ ] Perform well in USACO 2026 contests
- [ ] Break to round 3 in NYPC 2026
- [ ] Gold medal in 2026 KOI preliminary and final
- [ ] Publish a moderate paper by the end of 2026
- [ ] Enjoy life until the end of highschool
